# Game Of Life

This is one of my old projects on this topic, which I am going to develop on a more or less civilian level and modern technology. So soon something new!)))

The project was built on the 4.8 framework, forms and MVVM patterns. The implementation is not neat, but it functions and has additional features:

     - Choice of cell size from 2 pixels;
     - Selection of the density of the basic generation of cells on the field;
     - Selection of the time interval between generations / generations;
     - Draw new cells while playing the game with the mouse button pressed on the playing field;
     
Enjoy!!!
